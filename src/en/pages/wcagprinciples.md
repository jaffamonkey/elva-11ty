In order for your web or mobile app to be accessible, the audience needs to be factored into the design and development. 

- people with sight loss, low vision or who use a screen reader
- those with colour deficiencies or colour blindness
people with hearing loss or who are deaf
- those with limited dexterity
- those with learning difficulties, like dyslexia, those who are autistic or have ADHD

> What are the four principles of content accessibility (POUR)?
- Perceivable
- Operable 
- Understandable
- Robust 

# Perceivable
## Relevant senses
- sight
- hearing
- touch
The content on your website needs to be perceivable to at least one of the senses.

# Operable
There are many different ways that people might interact with your website.
- keyboard navigation
- screen reader
- speech recognition software.

# Understandable
People with dyslexia can struggle with reading and lots of text. Others on the autism spectrum, can struggle with metaphorical and figurative language.

## A general guide

- remove jargon or complex language
- break up long paragraphs
- headings to break up long pages
- short bullet points
