## No Redeeming Features
_Film & Theatre Production | Est. 1998_

Founded by Emma Malin and David Parker in 1998, No Redeeming Features is an award-winning film and theatre production company known for its dark humour, bold storytelling, and creative flair.

From winning The Foundry Horror Fest in 1999 with a trilogy of short horror films, to taking home Best Film in the UK-wide 48 Hour Film Challenge with The Modernista in 2001, we've consistently pushed boundaries across genres. That same year, we were honoured with Film of the Year by the Fringe Report.

Our original street theatre production, What The Dickens?, reimagined the life and works of Charles Dickens with a gothic twist. Performed two years running, it became a standout piece thanks to our collaboration with The Page Mason School of Dance & Drama.

Over the years, we've toured nationally with our cult-favourite Rocky Horror Picture Show Shadow Cast, and worked closely with local drama schools and emerging talent.

For the past 17 years, we've proudly contributed to the iconic Notting Hill Carnival, designing and producing a theatrical static sound stage on Talbot Road.

Our creative reach also extends into commercial work, including a full campaign for luxury leather goods brand Claremont. Most recently, we partnered with legendary game creator Mark Rein-Hagen as writers and associate producers on the teaser film for his latest project, I Am Zombie.
